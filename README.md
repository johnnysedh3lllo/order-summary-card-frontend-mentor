## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
with this challenge i was able to learn how to use the **HTML <source> srcset Attribute**.

```html
<picture>
    <source class="desktop-back" media="(min-width: 375px)" 
    srcset="pattern-background-desktop.svg">
  <img class="mobile-back" src="pattern-background-mobile.svg" alt="">
    </picture>
```

### Continued development
in the later challenges i will be focusing on understanding responsive layouts and CSS Grid, as stated before.
